## How to Set Environment Variables in Vercel

1. Go to your Vercel dashboard
2. Select your project
3. Go to Settings â†’ Environment Variables
4. Add each variable above
5. Make sure to set them for "Production" environment
6. Redeploy your project

## Important Notes

- The `VITE_API_URL` is the most critical variable - it should point to your deployed backend
- All variables must start with `VITE_` to be accessible in the frontend
- After setting the variables, you need to redeploy for them to take effect
- The frontend will fallback to the hardcoded URL if the environment variable is not set

## Current Configuration

The frontend is currently configured to use:
- **Default API URL**: `https://dental-website-backend-v2.fly.dev/api`
- **Fallback**: If `VITE_API_URL` is not set, it will use the default URL above

This means your frontend will work even without setting environment variables, but it's recommended to set them for better control.
